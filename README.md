# rest-api-node

I have a restful nodeJS, where it displays table data and can query, include, and delete with the post, get, delete, put methods. Separated in MVC format.

the directories <br>
/banco/dbconnection.js -> configuration with database <br> 
/model/AnswerClass.js -> Auxiliary Data <br>
/model/portifolio/PortifolioModel.js -> Database Abstraction <br>
/router/portifolioRouter.js -> Portifolio link routes <br>
api.js -> nodejs service connection configuration
