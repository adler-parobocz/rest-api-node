# rest-api-node

I have a restful nodeJS, where it displays table data and can query, include, and delete with the post, get, delete, put methods. Separated in MVC format.

the directories
/banco/dbconnection.js -> configuration with database
/model/AnswerClass.js -> Auxiliary Data
/model/portifolio/PortifolioModel.js -> Database Abstraction
/router/portifolioRouter.js -> Portifolio link routes
api.js -> nodejs service connection configuration
